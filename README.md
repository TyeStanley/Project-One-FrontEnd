# Weekly Food Planner

Hello and welcome to our Weekly Food planner app. Our motivation for developing this web app is because we want to improve peoples lifes who don't have time to properly plan out a proper weekly meal. With a simple search you can find plenty of recipes that you can sort through and set up an automatic grocery list that would be instantly texted or emailed with the selection that you have chosen. Making your upcoming week a breeze.
